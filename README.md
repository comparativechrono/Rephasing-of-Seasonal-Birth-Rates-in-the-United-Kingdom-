## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **`figure-notebooks/`**  
  Notebooks used to generate each figure in the paper. Fully reproducible and self-contained.

- **`lab-book/`**  
  A working notebook capturing the full chronological flow of the analysis, including exploratory work, drafts, and decisions made during the project.

- **`time-series/`**  
  Contains the time series datasets used in the analysis (births, light, and temperature), including both full and segmented files.

- **`Additional_analysis/`**  
  Supplementary analyses from the lab book that did not appear in the main paper (e.g. curve fitting, seasonal decomposition).

## üß† About the Project

This study investigates long-term changes in the seasonality of human births in the United Kingdom, focusing on how peak birth timing has shifted over decades. The work considers environmental entrainment factors and offers implications for chronobiological studies relying on birth season as a proxy for prenatal light exposure.
