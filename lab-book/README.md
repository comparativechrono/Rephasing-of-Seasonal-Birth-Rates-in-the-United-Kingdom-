📓 ##Lab Book

This directory contains the main working notebook used during the development and execution of the analyses.

🧭 ##Purpose

While individual notebooks for each figure are provided for clarity and reproducibility, this lab book notebook reflects the full chronological workflow. It includes exploratory analyses, intermediate steps, notes, and decisions made throughout the project.

📄 ##Contents

A single Jupyter notebook capturing:

The full timeline of analysis work

Trial-and-error testing

Model iterations

Dead ends, insights, and final decisions

🔍 ##Why Include This?

This notebook is included alongside the cleaned figure notebooks to:

Preserve the logical and developmental flow of the project

Provide additional transparency into the analysis process

Offer context that may not be evident from the finalized notebooks

📌 ##Notes

This is a "live" document reflecting real-time work, not all code blocks may be cleanly formatted or optimized.

Some sections may refer to files or paths that were later reorganized.
