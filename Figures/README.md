📊 Figure Notebooks
This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used to generate each of the figures in the paper. Each notebook includes the code required to run the analysis and reproduce the corresponding figure.

📁 Structure
Each notebook is named according to the figure it produces (e.g., Figure_1.ipynb, etc.).

🧪 Contents
Data loading: Each notebook loads the necessary data from the home directory.

Analysis: All processing and statistical analysis needed for the figure is included in the notebook.

Plotting: The final cell in each notebook generates the figure shown in the paper.

🚀 How to Use
Launch Jupyter or VSCode.

Run the notebook from top to bottom to reproduce the figure.

📝 Notes
Notebooks are designed to be run independently.

All data must be downloaded separately from the `time-series` directory (see notes within each notebook).

Some figures may take longer to generate due to bootstrapping or simulations.
