ðŸ§ª Additional Analyses

This directory contains supplementary analyses that were conducted during the course of the project but were not included in the main paper. These notebooks are preserved here for completeness, reproducibility, and potential future exploration.

ðŸ“„ Contents

*   curve_fitting.ipynb

    Explores various models to fit the birth time series data, including sinusoidal and polynomial fits.

*   peak_time_analysis.ipynb

    Investigates changes in the timing of annual birth peaks across different time periods.

*   seasonal_decomposition.ipynb

    Applies time series decomposition techniques (e.g., STL, classical decomposition) to separate trend, seasonal, and residual components.

ðŸ“Œ Notes

*   These notebooks are referenced or developed within the main lab book but were not directly used in figure generation for the manuscript.

*   Some analysis paths explored here helped inform the main results and interpretations.

*   Each notebook is standalone and can be run independently.
